# 🐍 Python Learning Repository
This repository contains various Python files created during my learning journey. It was built during the early stages of my experience with the language, where I was exploring concepts, testing ideas, and practicing without much structure.

## ⚠️ ATTENTION ⚠️
The repository is a bit messy — the files are unorganized, and the commit history is inconsistent. This is because I was still a beginner at the time, learning both Python and how to properly use Git/GitHub.
Still, I decided to keep it public as a way to document my progress. It might be helpful for other beginners or anyone curious about the early stages of learning to code.
